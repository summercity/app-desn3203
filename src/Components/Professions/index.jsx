									A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of
									the deciduous woody vines of the flowering
									plant genus Vitis.
								</p>

								<p>
									Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes,
									used for making wine, jam, grape juice,
									jelly, grape seed extract, vinegar, and
									grape seed oil, or dried as raisins,
									currants and sultanas. Grapes are a
									non-climacteric type of fruit, generally
									occurring in clusters. The Middle East is
									generally described as the homeland of grape
									and the cultivation of this plant began
									there 6,000â€“8,000 years ago.

									Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a
									flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae
									family and the name of its edible fruit. A
									scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it
									was originally domesticated in Africa. It is
									a highly cultivated fruit worldwide.
								</p>

								<p>
									Watermelon is grown in favorable climates
									from tropical to temperate regions worldwide
									for its large edible fruit, which is a berry
									with a hard rind and is botanically called a
									pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep
									red to pink, although seedless varieties
									exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or
									pickled, and the rind is edible after
									cooking.
